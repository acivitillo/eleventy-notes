title: Schemas / Data Domains
---

Here is a very important thing to understand when architecting a data storage strategy for optimal analytics: **Database Schemas and Data Domains Are Not the Same**.

These concepts usually get confused because they are both ways to group data assets, yet one (database schemas) is only about grouping SQL tables, while the other one (data domains) is about grouping data products (dashboards, reports, tables, notebooks, etc.).

### **What Are Schemas?**  

Many analysts working with **relational databases (RDBMS)** are familiar with concepts like **tables and schemas**. In traditional **RDBMS environments**, a **schema** is a way to organize and group related tables.  

For example, a schema named **`customer`** might contain multiple tables related to customer data:  

- `customer.details`  
- `customer.orders`  
- `customer.support_tickets`  

Schemas help with **data organization and access control**, allowing administrators to **grant permissions at the schema level**. However, schemas are a **technical database construct**, not a governance model.  

### **What Are Data Domains?**  

A **data domain** is a **higher-level governance concept** used to group data assets **by business function, operational area, or organizational structure**. Domains help define **data ownership, responsibility, and access policies** beyond simple table grouping.  

For example, a **Sales team in China** using multiple sales-related data marts, dashboards, reports and tables could be assigned to a **`China Sales` domain**, which includes:  

- Various tables, dashboards and reports from different schemas  
- Data access policies aligned with business needs  
- A **domain owner** responsible for data governance  

### **Data Domains and Data Mesh: A Governance Perspective**  

In modern **Data Mesh architectures**, data domains play a **central role** in **decentralized data governance**. Unlike traditional **monolithic data warehouses**, where central IT teams manage all data, **Data Mesh promotes domain-driven data ownership**.  

Domains are **not just technical groupings** but **organizational units** responsible for:  

✅ **Defining Data Ownership** – Each domain has **domain owners** and **data stewards** accountable for data quality, security, and policies.  
✅ **Ensuring Data Quality & Documentation** – Domains maintain **clear data contracts** and governance rules.  
✅ **Enabling Cross-Team Collaboration** – Domains provide **data products** that other teams can consume without direct database access.  

### **The Problem with Confusing Schemas and Data Domains**  

Because **database schemas** group tables and support **access management**, many analytics professionals assume that **schema = data domain**. However, this is a **limited view** that can lead to governance challenges:  

❌ **Limited Ownership Clarity** – A schema groups tables but does not define **who owns** or is responsible for the data.  
❌ **Rigid Access Control** – Schema-level permissions do not account for **business-driven access needs**, such as **role-based access per department or region**.  
❌ **Lack of Business Context** – A schema only provides a **technical structure**, while data domains define **business meaning, policies, and governance.**  
❌ **Limited Visibility across data assets** – A schema only applies to **database tables**, while data domains are used to group various assets such as dashboards, reports and other data procuts

### **Example: China Sales Data Domain**  

Let’s revisit our **`China Sales` domain**. Instead of just being a database schema, this domain would have:  

- **A domain owner** responsible for data governance.  
- **Defined data policies** for access control, security, and compliance.  
- **Clear SLAs and documentation** for teams consuming the data.  

By adopting **data domains as governance tools**, organizations move beyond **technical schemas** and **enable scalable, business-aligned data ownership**.
