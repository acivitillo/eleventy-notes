Welcome to **Automated Data Pipelines:** ***A Code-First Guide***, an opinionated guide, inspired by software engineering practices, to develop, deploy, automate and monitor data pipelines from ingestion to models. Our data pipelines are built in Python and SQL, version controlled in git, and enabled by a number of standard tools.

Automated Data Pipelines helps you understand how to best use the following tech stack:
- ✅ Python
- ✅ SQL
- ✅ dbt
- ✅ Prefect
- ✅ S3 Object Storage
- ✅ SQL Database or Lakehouse
- ✅ Azure, AWS and GCP Cloud
- and many more...

Whether you are a data analyst, data engineer or data scientist, our guide has you covered. Ever wondered how to avoid developing tech debt? Or what best practices you can leverage for developing data models? Here we are documenting exactly that.


## **Why Code-First?**  

Data pipelines have existed for over 30 years, likely emerging alongside **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** in **1993**—though some form of data pipelining predates even that. Often referred to as **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**, data pipelines have become an essential component of modern data infrastructure, powering analytics, reporting, and operational workflows.  

With the increasing demand for **data-driven decision-making**, pipelines have surged in both popularity and complexity. Today, organizations manage **hundreds or even thousands of pipelines**, many of which are mission-critical.  

### **The Pitfalls of UI-Based ETL Tools**  

Many vendors have promoted **low-code or no-code UI-based ETL tools** as a way to simplify pipeline development. While these tools offer a **shorter learning curve**, they introduce several challenges:  

❌ **Limited Talent Pool** – Niche, proprietary tools require specialized training, making hiring difficult.  
❌ **Poor Monitoring & Operations** – Debugging and troubleshooting in UI-driven tools is cumbersome.  
❌ **Complex Change Management** – Versioning, reviewing, and deploying changes lack standard software development best practices.  
❌ **Low Visibility & Governance** – UI-based workflows often lack lineage tracking, making auditing and compliance difficult.  

## **Why Code-First Pipelines?**  

The **"Pipelines as Code"** approach gained popularity with **Apache Airflow** and has since evolved into a broader **industry best practice**. Writing pipelines as code addresses many of the shortcomings of UI-based tools by applying **software engineering principles** to data engineering.  

### **Core Principles of Code-First, Automated Pipelines**  

✅ **Testing:** Data quality is only as good as the quality of your tests. Implementing unit, integration, and data integrity tests is essential.  

✅ **Collaboration:** Code-first pipelines enable teams to track, review, and approve changes via **Git-based version control**, improving transparency and teamwork.  

✅ **Reproducibility:** Every pipeline run should be **deterministic and versioned**, ensuring that past results can be replicated.  

✅ **Scalability:** Code-driven pipelines support **parameterization, modularity, and infrastructure-as-code**, making them easier to scale.  

✅ **Observability & Governance:** With structured logging, lineage tracking, and automated documentation, code-based pipelines enhance **visibility and compliance**.  

By adopting a **code-first approach**, organizations gain **better control, flexibility, and maintainability** over their data workflows—ensuring pipelines remain **robust, scalable, and auditable** in the long run.
